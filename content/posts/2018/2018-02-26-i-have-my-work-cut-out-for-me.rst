I've got my work cut out for me, converting over 255 posts dating as far
back as 2009 for Pelican_.

I suppose I could keep my posts in their original Markdown_ format, but
their metadata is for several versions of Jekyll_ â€” assuming they've been
converted to Markdown from WordPress_ HTML.

If I convert everything to reStructuredText_, I can at least check
everything for typos and perhaps do a better job of presenting images.
There's also the matter of theming my Pelican site. Perhaps I should
jazz up the templates using Bulma_ CSS.

And then there's the matter of pulling my content out of `Ghost Town`_.
That should be hilarious.
