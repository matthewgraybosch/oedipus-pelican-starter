Valerie Aurora's `post on leaving a toxic tech culture <https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2018/01/17/getting-free-of-toxic-tech-culture/>`_ is absolutely brilliant, and everybody who works in tech should read it.

That's right, *everybody*. Not just people working in Silicon Valley or for a startup. *Everybody*. I've worked for twenty years as a developer without ever setting foot in the Valley, but the attitudes Ms. Aurora decries are not local to SV. 

They're everywhere.
