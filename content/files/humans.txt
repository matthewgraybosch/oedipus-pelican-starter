/* SO, YOU FOUND MY HUMANS.TXT FILE */
  I doubt most people bother to look for this file in people's websites,
  so you're one of a rare breed of Web surfer. Assuming you're classified
  as human yourself, and aren't a robot or a meat popsicle.

  If you ARE human, thanks for visiting. I hope you stick around a while
  and come back often to find new goodies. Something like a CATS.TXT file,
  perhaps? Heh-heh-heh.
