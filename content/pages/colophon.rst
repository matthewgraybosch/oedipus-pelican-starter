Colophon

:summary: Technical information about this website and its design
:slug: colophon


**matthewgraybosch.com** is hosted by Dreamhost_, and has been in one form or another for almost ten years. I run this website myself, and build it using free and open source software such as:

- Pelican_
- Vim_
- OpenBSD_

You can view the code I use on GitHub, and use my Oedipus_ Pelican Starter for your own projects. It's solid; I'm eating my own dog food here.

About the Blog
==============

The blog_ is called "A Day Job and a Dream" because of a marketing slogan that the New York Lottery had used when I first started writing. They used to say, "All you need is a dollar and a dream," to have a shot at winning the lottery. 

Since the odds of making a living as an author are little better than those of hitting the lottery, I had taken to saying about being a writer: "All you need is a *day job* and a dream."

License Information
===================

Any code I create is available under the terms of the `GNU General Public License, v3 <http://gplv3.fsf.org/>`_.

Any code I use that other people wrote is governed by the terms of the licenses *they* chose.

Privacy Information
===================

The only information I *personally* collect from you is your name and email address, and that's *only* if you go to my subscription_ page and subscribe to my newsletter for updates. I don't sell the information I collect to third parties, or share it with them, but if the Feds show up with a warrant there isn't a hell of a lot I can do. However, the Feds haven't demanded my mailing list *yet*.

With that said, you should still be aware that pages on my site that contain embedded content from other websites -- such as YouTube and Spotify -- may also contain tracking code from those websites. They may also attempt to place cookies on your device.

The  Lynx_ text-mode browser is the safest way to visit this site. Lynx is a good kitty and doesn't implement JavaScript. Don't worry; you can read this site with Lynx. I know this because I tested it.
