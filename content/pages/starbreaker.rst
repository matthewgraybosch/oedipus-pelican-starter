**Starbreaker** is my idealistic cyberpunk science fantasy saga, inspired by classic heavy metal and progressive rock. All-too-human androids and swashbuckling sopranos fight demons from outer space. It's fucking metal.

Surely You Can't Be Serious
===========================

I'm as serious as cancer, and don't call me Shirley. Get stoned if you must, but close your eyes and imagine an Earth where...

* First contact happened over 10,000 years ago.
* Aliens have lived among us throughout the history of civilization.
* Humanity has begun to colonize the entire solar system while still healing the scars of a global collapse they remember as _Nationfall_.
* Benevolent artificial intelligence works alongside humans.
* An elite corps of tribunes investigates and punishes abuses of power wherever they occur under the aegis of the Phoenix Society.
* All-too-human androids rock out with swashbuckling sopranos.
* The gods came from outer space.
* An ancient evil is bound beneath the ice of Antarctica.
* The dark lord wears white, already rules the world, and is trying to save it.
