:summary: Who the hell is Matthew Graybosch, anyway?
:slug: about


I'm the author of several novels, among them *Without Bloodshed* and
*Silent Clarion*. I've also written several short stories, including
"The Milgram Battery" and "Limited Liability". I'm supposed to be
writing a new novel called *Shattered Guardian*, and I might finish it
before Ragnarok.

I grew up in Sayville, NY and currently live in Harrisburg, PA with
my wife Catherine and several cats. I have a day job as a software
developer for a large consultancy, but I don't identify my employer
because everything I post online is *strictly* my own opinion.

Author Bio
==========

According to official records maintained by the state of New York,
Matthew was born somewhere on Long Island in 1978.

Urban legends suggest he might be Rosemary’s Baby or the result of
top-secret DOD attempts to continue Nazi experiments combining human
technology and black magic. The most outlandish tale suggests that he
sprang fully grown from his father’s forehead with a sledgehammer in one
hand and the second edition of *The C Programming Language* in the other
— and has been giving the poor man headaches ever since.

The truth is more prosaic. Matthew is an author from New York who lives
with his wife and cats in central Pennsylvania. He is also an avid
reader, a long-haired metalhead, and an unrepentant nerd with delusions
of erudition.

*Without Bloodshed* (2013) is his first published novel, followed by
*Silent Clarion* (2016). He has also written short stories like "The
Milgram Battery" and "Limited Liability". He is allegedly working on the
next Starbreaker novel, *Shattered Guardian*, but sources within the NSA
suggest he’s doing nothing of the sort.

His day job is software development, and we're not sure how he remains
sane. We could ask, but we suspect he’d say, "I'm not sane. I’m
high-functioning."
