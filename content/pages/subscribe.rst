:summary: Information on how to subscribe and get updates.
:slug: subscribe

If you want to follow me and get updates, there are a couple of ways to go about it. I provide `XML feeds for syndication <www.matthewgraybosch.com/feeds/>`_, and I also have a newsletter.

Atom Feeds
==========

You can subscribe to my site's Atom feeds with any modern feed reader to get recent posts. Atom feeds contain both the full text of a post and a summary, so you can read at your convenience.

* `Recent Posts (Atom) <http://www.matthewgraybosch.com/feeds/atom.xml>`_
* `All Posts (Atom) <http://www.matthewgraybosch.com/feeds/all.atom.xml>`_

RSS Feeds
=========

RSS is an older XML syndication tech, which I provide for readers whose preferred feed-reading software can't handle Atom. You'll have to visit for the full story.

* `Recent Posts (RSS) <http://www.matthewgraybosch.com/feeds/rss.xml>`_
* `All Posts (RSS) <http://www.matthewgraybosch.com/feeds/all.rss.xml>`_

Newsletter
==========

You can subscribe and get updates by email. You won't get many emails from me because newsletters are a pain in the ass to write, so I won't bother unless I have something really important to announce, like the publication date of a new novel.
